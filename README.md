Machine learning project to predict customer churn and explain key drivers using interpretable AI techniques.
# Customer Churn Prediction with Explainable AI

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical problems faced by subscription-based and service-driven businesses. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, and more importantly, to **explain the reasons behind churn predictions** using interpretable AI techniques.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to identify:
- Which customers are likely to leave
- Why customers are leaving
- What actions can reduce churn

Manual analysis is time-consuming and reactive. This project aims to provide a **data-driven, proactive churn prediction system**.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
The solution follows a complete data science pipeline:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Machine learning model training  
5. Model evaluation  
6. Explainability using feature importance and SHAP values  

The final model not only predicts churn but also highlights **key factors influencing customer decisions**.
